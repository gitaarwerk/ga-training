# Measure button-interaction

## Assignment 2a: Check how many times the button is clicked
When you create a form, it would be good to see if there are any clicks on this
Set an event on the button: `Yes, I would like to sign-up`.

**Tip**: *Give the category of the event `<your name>: sign-up button` to help you recognize your click instead of one of your other class mates)*

## Assignment 2b: Find your event in Google Analytics
See if your event is caught.

## Why do we need this?
Buttons are used a lot in interfaces. While with forms, you can easily measure a form submission by the data coming in. However, 
it is valuable to know when the same user do other actions as well as measure general conversion rather than on per-case-base
Also, other than using forms, buttons performs interactions, like opening or closing menus, panels, etcetera. 
Because they may not send any data, it is often not so obvious how often is interacted with these kind of functionalities.

Using events, we can track the user's intention and measure conversion.
