# Introduction to enhanced e-commerce

## Assignment 4a: Install the enhanced e-commerce plugin
Enhanced e-commerce is one of the official Analytics plugins by Google. They are well integrated in 
the dashboards. Your assignment is to now add this plugin to the set-up of Analytics.js.

## Assignment 4b: Create a `transaction` with the value of the donation filled in by the user
On the training page, there is a second form with the possibility to make a donation.
Set-up an e-commerce transaction with the value supplied by the form. 
 

## Assignment 4c: Send the `purchase` to Google Analytics and check the console
A transaction will only be complete when a purchase is made. This is because in some e-commerce solutions, there
can be more than just one transaction. To make sure the data gets to Google Analytics, create the purchase now.

## Class assignment 4d: Let's explore the sales performance
Since transactions will be available after an hour or more, it's not possible to see direct results.
So let's explore some of the data that's already there.

## Why do we need this?
Adding e-commerce transactions and purchases will give much extra value of reading reports. It can help back-up
business but also technical decisions. As an example of a technical decision: "What browsers should we still support?"
Maybe, there are browsers that are not used much more. While perhaps it still gets a lot of hits, but it just simply isn't possible
to make a purchase anymore (due to SSL conflicts on IE6, for example). It is hard to say, let's not support it anymore
when numbers are still big. But when you add value to the equasion, it suddenly becomes a lot more clear.   

You can also spot trends while same amount of transactions occur, but value would be higher on a Apple Mac in contrary of a
PC running Windows. Value does not only give reporting on revenue, but also invites to get more insights.

**Tip**: *You can do a whole lot of different things with e-commerce tracking. But the bare minimum would always be the
transaction/purchase. This would give sufficient information to work with.
