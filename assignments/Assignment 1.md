# Setting up the developer console

## Assignment 1a: Change the page title
Open the `training-material`-folder and open `index.html` and change the page title 
to something you can recognize, like your name.

## Assignment 1b: Enabling the development console
Enable the development console.

## Assignment 1c: See if your page will send data to Google Analytics
Open the browser's console and refresh the page.

## Assignment 1d: Open GA, and find yourself visiting your page
1. In the `README.md`, open the link to the GA test account.
2. Explore the Analytics Real-time sections and find your page.

## Optional assignment: Customize your url
A page view always looks at the `URL` of your browser. However, they may not always be straightforward
nor usable. So in some cases, it is better to modify what we sent to GA.

Give the url that you send to Analytics a more recognizable name for you and find it in
Google Analytics Real-time reports.

## Why do we need this?
To test and debug what you will send to Google Analytics, and not testing in production,
this tool helps you to see what is being sent.
